# TODO

* All icon controls in IDE and top nav need to be made accessible.
* Figure out a better approach than copying node_modules/three into static/examples/vendor/three
* check all the favicon stuff on live site
* All three.js examples displayed in iframes should be hosted locally - they slow down page load and changes upstream may cause breakages
