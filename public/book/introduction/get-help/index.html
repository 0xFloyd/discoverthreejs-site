<h1 id="welcome-to-our-community-threejs-around-the-web">Welcome to Our Community: three.js Around the Web</h1>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that sets three.js apart from the competition more than anything else, it&rsquo;s the amazing community that will help and support you while you learn to use the library. No matter what your issue is, whether you need help with a thorny 3D math problem, are trying to understand some difficult syntax, have an idea for a new feature, want feedback on your work, or think that you&rsquo;ve found a bug, you can usually get a response in a matter of hours. Provided you ask in the right place, that is.</p>
<p>Here are some places around the web where you&rsquo;ll find the three.js folk hanging out.</p>
<h2 id="the-official-threejs-forum">The Official three.js Forum</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">

<p>The best place to ask for help, showcase your project, or engage in general three.js chitchat, is the <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official three.js forum</a>, which has been around since April 2017. It&rsquo;s highly active and you&rsquo;ll find lots of enthusiastic people there who will be happy to help you out.</p>
<p>Projects posted in the <a href="https://discourse.threejs.org/c/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcase category</a> may be selected for display on <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the three.js homepage</a>, which is updated a couple of times a year to display the best new projects from around the web.</p>
<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">
  <img src="/static/images/app-logos/discord.png" loading="lazy" alt="three.js Discord server logo" title="three.js Discord server logo"  /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/jYMz4sX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official three.js Discord server</a> is a great place to get to know the people who create beautiful things using three.js. It&rsquo;s also a great place to showcase your work or ask for help in a less formal setting than the forum.</p>
<h2 id="threejs-on-stackoverflow">three.js on StackOverflow</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">
  <img src="/static/images/app-logos/stackoverflow.png" loading="lazy" alt="StackOverflow logo" title="StackOverflow logo"  /></figure>
<p>Before the forum arrived, StackOverflow was the best place to ask three.js related questions, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you&rsquo;ll still find lots of useful information there</a>. The fastest way to get help with three.js is to post on <em>both</em> the forum and StackOverflow. However, if you do this, please crosslink your posts so the kind people who help you don&rsquo;t duplicate their work.</p>
<h2 id="threejs-on-github">three.js on GitHub</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">
  <img src="/static/images/app-logos/github.png" loading="lazy" alt="GitHub logo" title="GitHub logo"  /></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three.js GitHub repo</a> is a hive of activity, and if you do report a bug there, it will often be fixed in a matter of hours. However, <strong>the repo is not a help site</strong> and if you go there asking for help you will politely be asked to use the forum instead.</p>
<p>If you need to file a bug report, please <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read these guidelines</a> first.</p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>Slack, the bane of businesses everywhere. And of course, <a href="https://threejs.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzYxMzczODM2OTgxLTQ1YmY4YTQxOTFjNDAzYmQ4NjU2YzRhNzliY2RiNDEyYjU2MjhhODgyYWQ5Y2MyZTU3MWNkOGVmOGRhOTQzYTk#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you&rsquo;ll find three.js there too</a>.</p>
<h2 id="facebook">Facebook</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">
  <img src="/static/images/app-logos/facebook.png" loading="lazy" alt="Facebook logo" title="Facebook logo"  /></figure>
<p>On Facebook, it&rsquo;s all about the pages. Here&rsquo;s a couple to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/threejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three.js</a></li>

<h2 id="the-threejs-subreddit">The three.js Subreddit</h2>
<figure class="tiny left noborder">
  <img src="/static/images/app-logos/reddit.png" loading="lazy" alt="reddit logo" title="reddit logo"  /></figure>
<p>You can also try your luck with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three.js subreddit</a>, but beware of falling into the black hole of Reddit and having your life sucked away into a dreary existence of memes and trolling! In any case, it tends to be less active than the forum or discord.</p>

    <h2 id="watch-out-for-outdated-answers">Watch Out for Outdated Answers!</h2>
<p>three.js has a rapid development cycle. When you are searching through old forum posts, especially on StackOverflow, beware of out of date information. Older answers are still useful, but the solutions might have to be adapted to work with recent versions of three.js. Keep an eye out for any warnings logged to the browser console to let you know you are using outdated syntax.
