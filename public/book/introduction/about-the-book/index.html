<h1 id="how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</h1>
<p>This book is a complete introduction to using the web as a platform for creating professional-quality 3D applications using three.js. There are many great tutorials for three.js available, not to mention the huge <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection of examples</a> on the three.js website. However, these tutorials and examples introduce three.js piece by piece, using small code snippets. This can be useful but falls short when it comes to creating a real-world, customer-facing application.</p>
<p>In this book, we take a more holistic approach. Here, we demonstrate how to use three.js to create complete, robust, professional-quality applications that follow best practices and <em>simply work</em> across all devices and modern browsers. While doing so, we&rsquo;ll split the code into small modules, each of which deals with a single aspect of the overall complexity. This means we can show you what a &ldquo;real&rdquo; three.js application looks like, while still writing code that is easy to follow.</p>
<p>In this Introduction, we cover everything you need to know <em>before</em> you start. <a href="/book/first-steps/">The main chapters</a> cover everything you need to get a basic 3D scene running in a web browser, including how to create objects, lights, cameras, camera controls, and how to organize and move objects around in your scenes. We&rsquo;ll finish by taking a look at how to load complex animated models created in an external program.</p>
<h2 id="prior-knowledge">Prior Knowledge</h2>
<p>Creating 3D applications that run in a browser falls at the intersection of web development and computer graphics, and by the time you finish this book, you&rsquo;ll have a deep understanding of both fields. However, here at the very start of the book, we will assume almost zero prior knowledge, and whenever possible, we&rsquo;ll explain topics and jargon as we come to them. On the rare occasion that introducing a topic would break the flow of a chapter we&rsquo;ll refer you somewhere else or to another section of this book where you can study it further.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-and-web-development">JavaScript and Web Development</h3>
<p>The main language we use throughout this book is JavaScript. You need to know the basics of this language to work with three.js, but you don&rsquo;t need to be an expert, and the same applies to HTML, CSS, and other aspects of web development. However, turning this book into a tutorial on web development or JavaScript would distract from our goal of learning three.js. As a result, most of the technical JavaScript details have been relegated to the <a href="/book/appendix/">Appendices</a>. Whenever we encounter a new JavaScript feature, we&rsquo;ll provide a link to the relevant section in the appendix, or a reliable external site like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN</a>.</p>
<h3 id="math-knowledge">Math Knowledge</h3>
<p>To move objects around in 3D space, we&rsquo;ll use some concepts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linear algebra</a>, such as vectors and matrices, while 3D space itself is described using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesian coordinate system</a>. However, you might be surprised how little mathematical knowledge you need to use three.js. The library does an amazing job of hiding all the complicated technical details. <em>Until you need them</em>, that is.</p>
<p>If at some point you want to study linear algebra or any other math topic more deeply, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> is one of the best resources on the web for learning mathematics, and their <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linear algebra course</a> has everything you need to get through this book.</p>
<h2 id="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
<p>This book features a custom-built live code editor that you can use to follow along with the code described in the text. This allows us to sidestep the complexities of setting up a web server and concentrate on learning three.js. If you&rsquo;re viewing this page on a large screen, the editor will open automatically alongside the text, otherwise, click the {% include 'partials/icons/solid/columns.svg' %} button on the top left of the navigation bar. Any changes you make to the code will show up right away in the preview window.</p>
<h3 id="before-and-after-code-comparison">Before and After Code Comparison</h3>
<p>See the big toggle switch at the top left of the editor? Go ahead and give it a try. Most chapters start with a partially completed example for you to work from, and also let you insta-completeâ„¢ the code with a single flick of this toggle. You can switch back and forth between the complete and initial states, and make changes to both separately.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-your-own-machine">Working on your own Machine</h2>
<p>Working on your own computer is referred to as <em>working locally</em> in web dev land. If you prefer to do this rather than using the editor, you can download the files as a zip file using the {% include 'partials/icons/solid/download.svg' %} button. This zip file will contain the files currently displayed. In other words, if the comparison toggle is to the right, you&rsquo;ll get the completed code, and if it&rsquo;s to the left, you&rsquo;ll get the starting code, in both cases along with any changes you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>If you are working locally, once we come to loading textures and 3D models in <a href="/book/first-steps/transformations/">1.5: Transformations and Coordinate Systems</a> and <a href="/book/first-steps/load-models/">1.13: Load 3D Models in glTF Format</a> you&rsquo;ll need to set up a local development server. The reason for this is that web browsers have security restrictions to prevent malicious websites from loading files directly from your computer&rsquo;s file system. Check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Run Things Locally</a> in the three.js docs for more information on this topic.</p>
<h2 id="official-documentation-and-source-code">Official Documentation and Source Code</h2>
<p>You should use this book alongside the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official three.js documentation</a> and the <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official examples</a>, and you will be referred to each of these frequently. Once you&rsquo;re more familiar with the library, you&rsquo;ll also find the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three.js source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code for the plugins</a> useful in furthering your understanding.</p>
