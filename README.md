# Welcome to Discover three.js!

This is the public repo for the book [Discover three.js](https://discoverthreejs.com/).

Pull requests are welcome, especially for:

* Keeping the book up to date with new three.js releases.
* Errata in the text or code examples.
* Any other bugs, browsers, or CSS issues.
* Search through the markdown folder for "TODO" if you're looking for inspiration ^_^

## Developer Guide

Here is the process for building and viewing the book.

Prerequisites: Node.js, [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Download the Hugo _extended_ binary for your system [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and place it in the project root. Tested with Hugo V0.82.1.
2. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Go to `http://localhost:1313/` to view the site. You may need to make sure this port is open in your firewall.

_Note: Hugo can also be installed with package managers such as chocolatey on Windows or Snap on Mac - this hasn't been tested with the current build setup._

## Technical Details

The book is built with Hugo, and this repo follows a fairly typical folder structure for a Hugo project, although the `content/` folder has been renamed to `markdown/`.

### Important folders

* `markdown` - all the words in the book are contained here.
* `assets/src` - JS source code.
* `assets/scss` - SCSS styles for the book are here.
* `static` - all static files such as figures, fonts, models, textures, images, and favicons are here.
* `static/examples` - the code for the IDE examples are here. Each example is a `World` - for examples: `static/examples/worlds/first-steps/first-scene` contains the example for the chapter **First Scene**. See `static/examples/README.md` for more details.
* `/public` - files generated by Hugo with the command `npm run production` will go here.

## Notes

* [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/) are used to build [SCSS](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) and [JS](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/js/) assets. This means the Hugo extended version must be used.
