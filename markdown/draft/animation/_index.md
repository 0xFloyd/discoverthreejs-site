# Animating Your Scenes

{{< figure src="animation/banner.jpg" alt="" class="banner" >}}

## Chapter 12.1 [Unraveling the Animation System](/book/animation/animation-system/)

## Chapter 12.2 [Introducing Morph Targets](/book/animation/morph-targets/)

## Chapter 12.3 [Bones, Skinning, and Skeletal Animation](/book/animation/skeletal-animation/)

Three.js comes equipped with a powerful animation system which can handle all kinds of other fancy things such as [morph targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_target_animation) and [skeletal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation). However, its main purpose is to load animations created in other applications (as we'll see in **Section 10: Working with other Applications**). This means that you can create complex animations in a 3D modeling  application such as Blender, 3D Studio Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, MotionBuilder, or hundreds of others, then load them into three.js and they will just work, with almost no effort on your part.
