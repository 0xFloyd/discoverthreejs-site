The other important type of camera is the [`OrthographicCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/OrthographicCamera). This uses [orthographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection), which means that objects don't get smaller as they get further away. This is often used for 2D games, or for user interfaces drawn on top of a 3D scene. We'll investigate both of these camera types in detail later in the section on cameras.
