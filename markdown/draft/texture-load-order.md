Following Mavridis [Mavridis 12], we exploit the human visual system’s low sensitivity to chroma varianceFinally, to improve user experience, we designed a texture load order that prevents ­distracting viewer flicker. Textures are loaded in the following order: opacity, diffuse, specular, light map, normal map, bump map, and emissive.keep engaging .matrixAutoUpdate = false for static or rarely moving objects and manual .updateMatrix() call when their position/quaternion/scale are updated instead so far?
