### What if You don't want to Create Physically Based Scenes?

Isn't this reliance on making everything physically correct limiting your creativity?

You'll be glad to know that this isn't the case. All this is doing is taking out the guesswork. Once we have a physically correct scene set up, we can take a **lighting rig** from one scene and put it into another, and be confident that it will behave as expected.

Even more importantly, we can create a material and use it in bright or dim situations without having to do lots of tweaking. This holds true whether you're creating a highly realistic architectural simulation, a crazy psychedelic dreamscape, or even a fully abstract deep dive into a fractal universe.
