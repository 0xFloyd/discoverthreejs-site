Images are split up into their separate components (AKA **channels**) for more efficient storage. In the case of JPG, an image has three channels - red, green, and blue. Together, we call these RGB. JPG images don't support transparency. PNG images _do_ support transparency, so we need to add an extra channel - red, green, blue, and **alpha**, or RGB**A**. If we create an image that _only_ stores transparency, then it will have only one  channel - alpha. Hence the name `alphaMap`.
