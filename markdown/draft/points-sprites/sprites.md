# Introducing Sprites



[Sprites](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/objects/Sprite) are provided as a plugin for the WebGLRenderer (although part of the core code so you don't need to do anything special to use them).
Sprites are 2D overlays that always face towards the camera and are often used for effects like graphical interfaces or labels.
